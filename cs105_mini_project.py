**1. What data do you have?**

The data we have is a collection of 78 questions and 217 answers from a Google Form where only 5 questions pertain to our overarching question. For these questions, we have both numeric and qualitative data which can be standardized into levels 1-5 depending on the set of answer choices. The questions relating to our project are:

1. How many meals do you typically eat per day?
   - Type of Data: Numeric
   - Answer Choices:
      - 1 meal (1)
      - 2 meals (2)
      - 3 meals (3)
      - more than 3 meals (4)


2. On average, how many cups of water do you drink per day?
   - Type of Data: Numeric
   - Answer Choices:
      - Less than 1 liter (about 34 oz)(1)
      - 1- 2 liters (about 34-68 oz)(2)
      - 2 - 3 liters (about 68-102 oz)(3)
      - 3 - 4 liters (about 102-135 oz)(4)
      - More than 4 liters (about 135 oz)(5)

3. How often do you eat breakfast?
   - Type of Data: Qualitative (Categorical)
   - Answer Choices:
     - Never (1)
     - Rarely (2)
     - Occasionally (3)
     - Most days (4)
     - Every day (5)

4. On average, how would you describe your energy levels throughout the day?
   - Type of Data: Qualitative (Categorical)
   - Answer Choices:
     - Very low (1)
     - Low (2)
     - Neutral (3)
     - High (4)
     - Very high (5)

5. How often do you consume caffeinated beverages?
   - Type of Data: Qualitative (Categorical)
   - Answer Choices:
     - Never (1)
     - Occasionally (2)
     - Sometimes (3)
     - Often (4)
     - Always (5)


*Data Standardization:*

- For the qualitative data, responses can be standardized into numerical values (1-5) to facilitate statistical analysis. For example, if someone answers "Occasionally" for the question "How often do you eat breakfast?", it can be standardized to 2.
  
- The numeric responses (e.g., number of meals per day or cups of water) are already suitable for analysis but may need further cleaning, such as handling missing or inconsistent entries.

**2. What would you like to know?**

Does a student's liquid intake(water and caffeinated beverages) and frequency and type of meals affects their energy levels throughout the day?

---
**3. Explore, present and analyze the data. (Generate statistics, perform visualizations)**

"""Here we seperate our different questions and energy values to show all the freqencies of our differnt surverys. Using this we induced that there could be strong correlations between our tests and the energy levels.

**Can you state any hypotheses or make predictions? Which tests can you apply to verify your hypothesis?**

**Hypotheses:**

1. The number of meals eaten per day affects your energy levels throughout the day.
   - **Prediction**: As the number of meals eaten per day increases, energy levels throughout the day may improve due to a more consistent energy supply from food intake.
   
2. The amount of water consumed per day affects your energy levels throughout the day.
   - **Prediction**: Higher water intake is associated with higher energy levels, as dehydration can lead to fatigue and lower energy levels.

3. How often you eat breakfast affects your energy levels throughout the day.
   - **Prediction**: People who eat breakfast more regularly will report higher energy levels throughout the day compared to those who skip breakfast or eat it less frequently.

**Tests to Verify Hypotheses:**

To verify these hypotheses, we applied the following statistical tests:

1. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**:
   - It compares the variance within each group to the variance between the groups to assess whether any observed differences are likely due to chance or if they reflect a true effect.

2. **Tukey's HSD Test**:
   - **Post-hoc analysis**: If the ANOVA shows significant differences in the groups, Tukeyâs HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) test can be used to determine which specific groups differ from
3. **Chi Square Analysis**
  - It compares the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies, and if the calculated Chi-Square statistic exceeds the critical value from the Chi-Square distribution, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a significant relationship.

Ho: Î¼1 = Î¼2 = Î¼3=Î¼4

Ha: at least one Î¼i is different from the rest

Our F-statistic is 2.7010 and our p-value is 0.0466 so when we compare it to our critical F-value(2.414) and our significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that at least one Î¼i is different from the rest which lead us to run a post-hoc test which is a Tukeyâs test.

A Tukeyâs test concludes that two or more means are significantly different and lessens the chances of a type I error compared to other post-hoc tests. We ran a Tukeyâs test and found that we can rank the groups of how many meals people eat a day compared to how much energy they have and we found that 3>1=2= more than 3 which suggests that 3 meals a day gives students more energy compared to eating 1,2,4, or more  meals a day.

Based on the results from each Chi-Square Value, here are our conclusions using a significance level of 0.05:


#### **Meals per Day vs Energy Levels:**
##### **Null Hypothesis**: There is no correlation between the number of meals eaten and the energy levels in a day.
With a calculated chi square value of ~22.301, and a calculated p-value of ~0.0343 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There exists a correlation between the number of meals eaten per day and the energy levels of that day.


#### **Water Intake vs Energy Levels**:
##### **Null Hypothesis**: There is no correlation between the amount of water intake and energy levels in a day.
With a calculated chi square value of ~23.914, and a calculated p-value of ~0.0914 > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There does not exist a correlation between the amount of water intake in a day and the energy levels of that day.


#### **Breakfast Frequency vs Energy Levels**
##### **Null Hypothesis**: There is no correlation between how often breakfast is eaten and energy levels in a day.
With a calculated chi square value of ~26.629, and a calculated p-value of ~0.0458 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There exists a correlation between how often breakfast is eaten and the energy levels in a day.


#**Final Thoughts**:
After reviewing our results, we can see that most of our comparisons with energy levels show a link between energy levels and diet, aside from water intake which had a p-value greater than our selected signficance level (0.05).

Our hypotheses are mostly supported also through the chi square test, however, water intake failed to show any signs of correlation with energy levels. We concluded that this could be due to food intake playing a larger role in energy levels overall, overshadowing water intake as a whole. Whether or not you have a high water intake, it will not raise energy levels as high if food intake is low. It is evident that eating breakfast often and more meals eaten a day raise energy levels, which prove our two hypotheses true.

Our study indicates that diet plays a large role in our day-to-day lifestyle, and taking care of our health with proper diet plans is crucial to allow us to perform at the highest in terms of physicality. Even though higher water intake is generally known to be beneficial, it is more important to eat enough and healthy for more significantly higher energy levels.
